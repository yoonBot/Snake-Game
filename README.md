# <h1 align="center"> Classic Snake Game (Sidewinder) 
  
## **`1. Rules`** 
##### 1. Snake grows every time it eats the target
##### 2. The target changes its location every time it is eaten
##### 3. The speed (fps) increases as the snake grows
##### 4. Consecutive keys pressed must not be opposite directions from one another (if left key is pressed, next key should not be right key).
##### 5. If you press opposite keys, snake dies and game is over. 

## **`2. Installation and Environment Setup`**
##### 1. VSCode 2017 editor was used, so you must download STD Library here. https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-devel-2.0.14-VC.zip
##### 2. Configure STD Library to VSCode environment by following the instructions in the following link. http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/windows/msvsnet2010u/index.php
##### 3. Copy all the source files in the SRC directory in this repository to the VSCode source files folder in a VSCode project. 
##### 4. When you build and start debugging, everything should be working just fine!
